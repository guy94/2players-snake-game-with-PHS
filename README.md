# 2players-snake-game-with-PHS
My snake game involves 2 players (player1- arrow keys, player2- w,a,s,d keys) chasing a piece of food.
the snakes are not allowed to collide or eat themselves (once passed a certain snake size).
There is a Pure-Heuristic-Search mode for the game where the snake "plays" by itself and chases the food.
By heuristics, the distance to the goal state (the piece of food in snake game) is evaluated, and the operation that minimizes that distance is chosen.

2-players mode:
