# 2players-snake-game-with-PHS
My snake game involves 2 players (player1- arrow keys, player2- w,a,s,d keys) chasing a piece of food.
the snakes are not allowed to collide (once passed a certain snake size).
There is a Pure-Heuristic-Search mode for the game where the snake "plays" by itself and chases the food.
